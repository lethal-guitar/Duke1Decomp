# Duke1Decomp

This repository contains snippets of decompiled/reconstructed Duke Nukem 1 source code.
At the moment, it serves as supplementary material to a (planned) series of blog posts about the game's engine and its internals.
It may or may not evolve into a full reconstruction/decompilation of the entire source code at some point.

The game seems to have been built with Borland Turbo C 2.0 originally.
