# Duke1Decomp

This repository contains snippets of decompiled/reconstructed Duke Nukem 1 source code.
At the moment, it serves as supplementary material to a series of blog posts about the game's engine and its internals.
It may or may not evolve into a full reconstruction/decompilation of the entire source code at some point.

All functions included here have been verified to be 100% matches with the original executable's disassembly when compiled with the right toolchain.

The game was originally built with Borland Turbo C 2.0 and Turbo Assembler 1.0,
the same toolchain as for Cosmo's Cosmic Adventures.
