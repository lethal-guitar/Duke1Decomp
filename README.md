# Duke1Decomp

This repository contains snippets of decompiled/reconstructed Duke Nukem 1 source code.
At the moment, it serves as supplementary material to a (planned) series of blog posts about the game's engine and its internals.
It may or may not evolve into a full reconstruction/decompilation of the entire source code at some point.

* [Duke Nukem 1's tile rendering](https://lethalguitar.wordpress.com/2023/11/04/duke-nukem-1s-tile-rendering/)

The game was originally built with Borland Turbo C 2.0 and Turbo Assembler 1.0,
the same toolchain as for Cosmo's Cosmic Adventures.
